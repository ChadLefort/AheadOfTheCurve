### About

A World of Wacraft addon that automates the sending of Ahead of the Curve achievments when signing up for raid groups via the Looking for Group system.

### Features

- Automates the sending of Ahead of the Curve achievments when signing up for raid groups via the LFG system.
- Currently only works for Legion raids.
- Determines highest achievment found for the raid your signing up for on your account (Cutting Edge, Ahead of the Curve, Normal/LFR Achievement).
- Allows you to override defaults by picking any achievement you have completed. This override will send for any Legion raid you sign up for.
- When signing up for a group you have the option to send a whisper or not. If no default achievement is found and no override is set no whisper will be sent.

### Future Additions

- Expand to Mythic+ and Karazhan
- Smart Send (Sends always based on group listing's title and description)
