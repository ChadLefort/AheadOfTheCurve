### About

A World of Warcraft addon that automates the sending of Ahead of the Curve achievements when signing up for raid groups via the Looking for Group system.

### Features

- Automates the sending of Ahead of the Curve and Mythic Plus achievements when signing up for groups via the LFG system.
- Helps links your Mythic Plus keystone when signing up for Mythic Plus dungeon.
- Determines highest achievement found for the raid your signing up for on your account.
  - Raids: Cutting Edge, Mythic End Boss Achievement, Ahead of the Curve, Normal/LFR Achievement

- Allows you to override defaults by picking any achievement you have completed. This override will send for any Battle for Azeroth raid or Mythic Plus dungeon group you sign up for.
